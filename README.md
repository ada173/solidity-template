# Solidity template with hardhat and dapptools

This is a solidity template with hardhat and dapp tools.
put the solidity contracts files are under `src/contracts`
put the dapptool related test files under `src/test`

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
